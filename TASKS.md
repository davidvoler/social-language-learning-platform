technical issues & question
---------------------------

When going to the next exercise - should we use a the standard routing with url or a much simpler ui routing
another option is just ot show hide the active url. 
I suggest to start simple - 
a service will load the full lesson
navigating to next will give the next exercise. from the service
later we can consider and replace it with ui-routing


using ui routing vs url routing

# Tornado should restart if html or javascript change
